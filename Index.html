<P> Every month we feature a famous lighthouse here on our homepage.  This month we are proud to feature the Cape Meares Lighthouse located in Cape Meares, Oregon. Opened in 1890 Cape Meares is the shortest lighthouse in Oregon standing at 38 feet. Photo curtosy of John Doe.</P>

<h3>Who are we?</h3>
   <p>We are fans of lighthouses also known as pharologists.  We are interested not just their history and structure, but also in preserving these unique buildings located around the world.</p>
   <p>The term "pharologist" refers to the famous Lighthouse of Alexandria which was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.</p> <!--Remembering to add <p> elements is a struggle as I keep wanting to format like a word document.-->
