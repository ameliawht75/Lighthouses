    <p>The earlist documentation of lighthouses is 1200 BC in Homer's The Illliad. <!--put in italics.-->  They were simple bonfires of wood or coal built on shore to guide ships.  Eventually large towers were constructed to allow the light to be seen on ship farther to sea. These towers would continue to use wood and coal to provide light. This would be the norm until the 18th Century when gas and electric lamps came into use.</p>

    <p>A Fresnel lens is a type of compact lens made up of a series of concentric grooves, designed to capture and focus light more efficiently than a traditional lens. Named after the French engineer Augustin-Jean Fresnel, who developed the concept in the early 19th century, these lenses are often much thinner and lighter than conventional lenses with the same focal length. The design reduces the amount of material required while still maintaining the lensâ€™s optical power. Fresnel lenses are commonly used in applications such as lighthouses, vehicle headlights, overhead projectors, and even in solar concentrators, where space and weight constraints are important. Their ability to concentrate light over large areas with minimal thickness has made them a versatile tool in both scientific and practical technologies.</p>
