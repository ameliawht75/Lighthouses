    <p>The earlist documentation of lighthouses is 1200 BC in Homer's The Illliad. <!--put in italics.-->  They were simple bonfires of wood or coal built on shore to guide ships.  Eventually large towers were constructed to allow the light to be seen on ship farther to sea. These towers would continue to use wood and coal to provide light. This would be the norm until the 18th Century when gas and electric lamps came into use.</p>

    <p>Developed in 1822 by Augustin Fresnel, the Fresnel lens is a collection of multiple glass prisms that allowed for an intense beam of light.  Along with the introduction of gas and electric lights allowed for lighthouses to be visible for up to 28 miles (45km).</p>
